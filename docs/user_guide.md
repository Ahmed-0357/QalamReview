### **Initial Configurations**

Below are the numbered configurations based on the above image:

#### **1. OpenAI API Key**

This API key is for the LLM model integration. In our case, we're using OpenAI ChatGPT which you can obtain its API-key [here](https://gptforwork.com/help/gpt-for-docs/setup/create-openai-api-key).

#### **2. Model Selection**

There are two available options:

- **gpt-3**: This is a faster and more cost-effective choice. However, please note that while it's efficient, its outputs might not always be entirely reliable.

- **gpt-3 & gpt-4**: In this mode, both gpt-3 and gpt-4 are utilized, however, gpt-4 is used for more creative and and advance reasoning tasks such as outline creation, assessing paper relevancy scores, and final manuscript write-up. This choice offers more accurate results. On the downside, costs might be slightly higher, and the running time can be longer.

#### **3. Custom Search API Key (Optional)**

For users who wish to utilize QalamReview's capability to scour the internet for the most relevant scholarly papers on a given topic, both this and the subsequent configuration are essential. The API key for the search engine can be accessed [here](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview#api_key).

#### **4. Custom Search Engine ID (Optional)**

You can obtain the Search Engine ID [here](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview#search_engine_id).
